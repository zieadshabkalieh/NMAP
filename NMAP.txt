1. Simple Scan:
  
   nmap <target>
   
   This basic command performs a default scan on the specified target, which can be an IP address or a hostname.

2. Port Scan:
   
   nmap -p <port(s)> <target>
   
   This command scans specific ports on the target. You can specify a single port, a range of ports, or a combination of both.

3. Scan all TCP ports:
   
   nmap -p- <target>
   
   This command scans all 65535 TCP ports on the target.

4. Service and Version Detection:
   
   nmap -sV <target>
   
   This command enables service and version detection, which helps identify the type and version of the running services on the target.

5. OS Detection:
   
   nmap -O <target>
   
   This command attempts to identify the operating system of the target.

6. Aggressive Scan:
   
   nmap -A <target>
   
   The aggressive scan option combines OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute all in one.

7. Scan using a specific script:
   
   nmap -sC -p <port(s)> <target>
   
   This command runs default scripts for the specified ports.

8. Scan multiple targets:
   
   nmap <target1> <target2> <target3>
   
   You can scan multiple targets simultaneously.

9. Save output to a file:
   
   nmap -oN <output.txt> <target>
   
   This command saves the scan results to a specified output file in normal format.

10. Scan using a script from the Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE):
   
   nmap -sC -p <port(s)> --script=<script-name> <target>
   
   This command allows you to run specific scripts from the NSE.
